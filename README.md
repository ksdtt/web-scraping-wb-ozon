# web-scraping-wb-ozon

This project is still in development. It is supposed to parse sites wildberries.ru and ozon.ru , data collection. 
Next, compare the data of marketplaces on the distribution of goods in them and test hypotheses. 
For example, maybe ozon is more for children, and wildberries for fashionistas? or vice versa?
